ngFlowPlayer
============

This is the beginnings of a flowplayer directive.  Please help make it better.

Usage:

I haven't figured out how to include the required scripts inside the module itself yet, so for now, make sure these are included
in your index.html
<head>
 <script type="text/javascript" src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"></script>
 <script type="text/javascript" src=//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.23/angular.min.js></script>
 <script type="text/javascript" src="http://releases.flowplayer.org/js/flowplayer-3.2.13.min.js"></script>
</head>
